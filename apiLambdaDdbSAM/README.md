# Serverless Application With API Gateway, AWS Lambda, and DynamoDB Using SAM

The objective of this project is to create two lambda functions. Out of which, one function will write datas to the DynamoDB table and the other function will read datas from the DynamoDB table. Moreover, both the functions will be invoked by API Gateway calls.
